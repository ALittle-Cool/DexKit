 DexKit
--

A dex parsing tool dedicated to better use.

The slicer directory is partially copied from [AOSP](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:frameworks/base/startop/view_compiler).

Modified parts are owed by LuckyPray Developers. If you would like to use it in an open source project, please submodule it.

Please see [main.cpp](https://github.com/LuckyPray/DexKit/blob/master/main.cpp) for usage examples.
